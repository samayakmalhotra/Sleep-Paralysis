Sleep Paralysis detection and intervention
This thesis project aims to develop a cost-effective real-time sleep paralysis detection and intervention system utilizing sleep camera recordings, AI techniques, and IoT integration. Our objective is to provide an innovative alternative to the current methods such as ECG and sensor based approaches. By harnessing the power of computer vision and AI algorithms, the system aims to accurately identify sleep paralysis episodes and deliver timely interventions in form of custom audio cues and adjusting room temperature to assist patients transitioning out of sleep paralysis. The research will involve the collection of sleep camera recordings from a diverse set of individuals experiencing sleep paralysis. These recordings will be used to train Deep learning models capable of recognizing specific patterns and characteristics associated with sleep paralysis episodes in patients.

The expected results of this research include the development of an efficient and reliable sleep paralysis detection and intervention system. The system's performance will be evaluated through extensive testing and validation, comparing its cost-effectiveness to traditional ECG and sensor-based methods. The conclusions drawn from this research will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and practicality of using sleep camera recordings and AI techniques for real-time sleep paralysis detection and intervention.
